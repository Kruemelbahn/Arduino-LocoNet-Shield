# Arduino-LocoNetShield

Arduino-LocoNetShield is just another LocoNet-Shield.

Why?

It is not only a LocoNet-Shield (this is the main usage and there are many other LocoNet-Shields...) but has also some more posibilities 
and became slighty a small develeopment-board for e.g.
- connection of SD-Card
- connection of Bluetooth-Module
- connector for IÂ²C-Bus
- has an (optional) EEPROM on board
- and some free space for your own components

For more please read the [short description] (Arduino-LocoNET-Shield V2 (en).pdf)([german](Arduino-LocoNET-Shield V2 (de).pdf))
